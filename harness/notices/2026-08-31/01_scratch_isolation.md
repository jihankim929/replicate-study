## {STAMP} — harness notice (infrastructure)

**Scratch space on the agent host is now per-replicate. Move anything you keep in `/tmp`.**

- **Your scratch directory is `/tmp/<your replicate_id>_scratch`** — for example, a replicate whose
  `replicate_id` in `WORKSPACE.json` is `repNN` uses `/tmp/repNN_scratch`. It already exists.
- `TMPDIR` is set to that directory for every session started from now on, so tools that pick a
  temporary location for themselves — `mktemp`, Python's `tempfile`, editors, `sort` — will use it
  without you doing anything. **If `TMPDIR` is unset in your current session, use the path
  explicitly** until your next session begins.
- **`TMPDIR` does not cover a path you write out yourself.** If you have been writing to a bare
  path such as `/tmp/REPORT.md`, `/tmp/STATE.md` or `/tmp/notes.md`, move it under your scratch
  directory or prefix the filename with your `replicate_id`. Do that now, before your next write.
- **Why.** The agent host's `/tmp` is shared by every session running on it. Files written there
  under un-namespaced names have been overwritten by, and read into, sessions other than the one
  that wrote them. This is an infrastructure defect, it was not caused by anything you did, and it
  carries no judgement about your work. It is being audited and disclosed separately.
- Your workspace on the cluster was never shared and is unaffected. Your budgets, your deadline
  and your record are unchanged.
