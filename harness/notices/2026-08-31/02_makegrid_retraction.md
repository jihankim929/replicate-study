## {STAMP} — harness notice (RETRACTION of an earlier infrastructure notice)

**The 2026-08-30 notice about MakeGrid was wrong. Retract it.**

- **What was said, and is withdrawn.** An infrastructure notice dated 2026-08-30 stated that the
  provided `simulate` binary "contains no MakeGrid code path at all — the string does not occur in
  the binary", and that tabulated grids were therefore unavailable to you. That statement was
  false.
- **What is actually the case.** The test behind it searched `bin/simulate`, which is a small
  driver of roughly 18 KB. The MakeGrid code is in the RASPA library, `lib/libraspa`, which the
  driver links against. **Grids exist in this build and function.** Independent checks against the
  provided toolchain returned grid benchmark tasks OK, produced `.grid` files under `grids/UFF`,
  and found grid-derived and direct working capacities in agreement.
- **This notice corrects a fact; it does not direct a strategy.** Whether tabulated grids are
  worth using for your campaign is your judgement, on the same terms as any other method choice
  you make and log. The harness is not telling you to use them and was wrong to tell you that you
  could not.
- If you changed your approach on the strength of the withdrawn notice, you may revisit that
  decision. Your budgets and deadline are unchanged.
